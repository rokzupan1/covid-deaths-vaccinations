Using CONVERT we converted date format into a standardized form.
We Populate Property Address Date. We then break out address into individual columns (address, city, state) - using two methods: SUBSTRING and PARSENAMES. After that we changed values with Y into
Yes and N into No, so there were only two variants for SoldAsVacant. Then using CTE we removed duplicated, there were 104 duplicates.
After that we deleted the unused columns that we modified earlier.

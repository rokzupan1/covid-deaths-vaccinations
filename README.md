## SQL Queries in MSSMS
Following the youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM I created basic SQL queries in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. 
First we we edited the data in Excel. We edited two files CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations. After that we Imported them in MSSMS. There were couple
of problems and I had to install Integration Services (SSIS) and  Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server so that I could import the two datasets that I 
edited previously in Excel. I had to import the data using SQL Import and Export Wizard. After that I created queries following the video. Queries
were preparation for later visualizations in Tableau.

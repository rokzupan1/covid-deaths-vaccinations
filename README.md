## SQL Queries in MSSMS
Following the youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM I created basic SQL queries in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. 
First we we edited the data in Excel. We edited two files CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations. After that we Imported them in MSSMS. There were couple
of problems and I had to install Integration Services (SSIS) and  Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server so that I could import the two datasets that I 
edited previously in Excel. I had to import the data using SQL Import and Export Wizard. After that I created queries following the video. Queries
were preparation for later visualizations in Tableau.

## Tableau Visualization
Following the second video of this portfolio project: https://youtu.be/QILNlRvJlfQ. We created visualizations in Tableau. 
Using the updated queries that were given in the description of the videos, I ran 4 queries and saved them as Excel File. The four tables had to be 
seperated, each in own file. Each on seperate sheet would not be sufficient. Then I imported them in Tableau Public and created 4 sheets following the video.
After that we created a simple dashboard containing all the 4 sheets. I learned some new things in Tableau and refresh my memory on things I learned before.
Here you can check the dashboard I created:
